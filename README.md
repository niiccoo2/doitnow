# Do Now Autograder

This project was made to help with grading over 1000 assignments every month.

# Features:

1. Uses .csv file from google form.
2. Does not grade submissions on weekends. (Using datetime)
3. Only grades one submison per day per user.
4. If more than 50% of people don't respond one day ask if you don't want to grade that day.

# TODO:

1. Figure out how many diffrent people respond that month.
2. If someone usualy responds with orange class and once with yellow ask if you want to change that resonse to orange class.
3. Maybe make if 50% don't respond thing per class?
